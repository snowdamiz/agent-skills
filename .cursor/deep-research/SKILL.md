# Deep Research

## When to Use

- User asks to research a technology, library, or framework
- User wants to investigate implementation approaches
- User asks to explore options or alternatives
- User requests a deep dive into a topic
- User asks to look into or find out about something
- User wants comprehensive information before making decisions
- User asks about best practices or latest patterns
- User wants to understand how something works in detail

## Prerequisites

- WebSearch tool must be available for internet searches
- Codebase search tools (SemanticSearch, Grep, Glob, Read) for context gathering

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Preparation

#### 1.1 Note the Current Date

Check the current date from the system information. This is critical for:
- Including the current year in search queries to get recent results
- Filtering out outdated information
- Understanding the recency of sources

Example: If the current date is January 2026, include "2026" or "2025-2026" in searches.

#### 1.2 Parse the Research Question

Identify from the user's question:
- **Primary topic**: The main subject to research
- **Specific aspects**: Any particular angles or sub-topics mentioned
- **Context clues**: Technology stack, use case, or constraints mentioned
- **Depth required**: Quick overview vs comprehensive analysis

### Phase 2: Codebase Context Gathering

Before external research, understand the existing codebase context.

#### 2.1 Search for Related Code

Use SemanticSearch with queries like:
- "How does [topic] work in this codebase?"
- "Where is [technology] used?"
- "What patterns are used for [concept]?"

#### 2.2 Check Dependencies

If researching a technology/library:
- Check `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `mix.exs`, or relevant dependency files
- Note current versions being used
- Look for related configuration files

#### 2.3 Read Relevant Files

Read key files identified in the search to understand:
- Current implementation patterns
- Existing conventions
- Integration points

**Document findings** before proceeding to web research.

### Phase 3: Web Research (Minimum 10 Sources)

Execute at least 10 web searches covering diverse source types. Include the current year in queries to prioritize recent content.

#### 3.1 Required Search Categories

Perform searches in ALL of these categories:

**Official Sources (2-3 searches)**
```
"[topic] official documentation [year]"
"[topic] docs guide"
"[topic] API reference"
```

**Tutorials & Guides (2-3 searches)**
```
"[topic] tutorial [year]"
"[topic] getting started guide"
"how to implement [topic] [year]"
```

**Community Discussions (2-3 searches)**
```
"[topic] best practices [year]"
"[topic] Stack Overflow"
"[topic] Reddit discussion [year]"
```

**Technical Articles (2-3 searches)**
```
"[topic] blog post [year]"
"[topic] explained"
"[topic] deep dive article"
```

**Comparisons & Alternatives (1-2 searches)**
```
"[topic] vs alternatives [year]"
"[topic] comparison"
"best [category] libraries [year]"
```

**GitHub & Repositories (1-2 searches)**
```
"[topic] GitHub examples"
"[topic] implementation repository"
```

#### 3.2 Search Execution

Run searches in parallel batches when possible:

```
Batch 1: Official docs + Tutorials (4 searches)
Batch 2: Community + Articles (4 searches)
Batch 3: Comparisons + GitHub (2-3 searches)
```

#### 3.3 Source Quality Assessment

For each source, evaluate:
- **Recency**: Prefer sources from the current or previous year
- **Authority**: Official docs > recognized experts > general blogs
- **Relevance**: Direct match to the research question
- **Depth**: Comprehensive coverage vs superficial mentions

### Phase 4: Synthesis & Report

Compile findings into a structured research report.

#### 4.1 Report Structure

```markdown
# Research Report: [Topic]

**Research Date**: [Current Date]
**Sources Consulted**: [Number of sources]

## Executive Summary
[2-3 paragraph overview of key findings]

## Key Findings

### [Category 1: e.g., "Core Concepts"]
- Finding 1 with explanation
- Finding 2 with explanation

### [Category 2: e.g., "Implementation Patterns"]
- Finding 1 with explanation
- Finding 2 with explanation

### [Category 3: e.g., "Best Practices"]
- Finding 1 with explanation
- Finding 2 with explanation

## Relevance to This Codebase
[How findings relate to existing code, patterns, and architecture]

## Recommendations
1. [Actionable recommendation 1]
2. [Actionable recommendation 2]
3. [Actionable recommendation 3]

## Sources
1. [Source Title](URL) - Brief description
2. [Source Title](URL) - Brief description
...
```

#### 4.2 Citation Guidelines

- Include source URLs for all referenced information
- Note the publication/update date when available
- Distinguish between official documentation and community content
- Flag any conflicting information between sources

## Best Practices

### Do

- Always include the current year in at least half of your searches
- Cross-reference information across multiple sources
- Prioritize official documentation over blog posts for API details
- Note version numbers when researching libraries/frameworks
- Highlight any breaking changes or deprecations found
- Connect research findings back to the user's specific context

### Don't

- Stop at fewer than 10 web searches
- Rely on a single source for important information
- Include outdated information without noting it's outdated
- Skip the codebase context phase
- Present opinions as facts without attribution
- Ignore conflicting information - address it explicitly

## Examples

## Error Handling

If web searches return limited results:
1. Broaden search terms
2. Remove year constraints temporarily
3. Search for related/similar technologies
4. Note the limitation in the report

If codebase context is minimal:
1. Note this is a new area for the project
2. Focus more heavily on best practices for greenfield implementation
3. Include setup/integration guidance in recommendations
